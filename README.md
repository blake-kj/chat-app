# Chat App

My final project for CS50, Harvard's introductory computer science course. I devoted the majority of my spare time to the course which allowed me to complete it in just over three weeks.

### Project Description
My CS50 final project is heavily inspired by the finance app created in problem set 9 of the course. Chat App was developed in Python and uses Flask as the Web Server Gateway Interface. In order to store uses and conversations a database was used in sqlite3. Passwords are hashed before storing in the database for additional security.
